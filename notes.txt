KnotAli Implementation and Design Notes.

Joseph Zieg Mar/April 2019

[NOTES]

    It seems that compiling input for a consensus sequence AND a consensus structure will take most
    of the ViennaRNA's implementation for RNAalifold. This may pose some issues in terms of exactly
    how the pseudoknot-free structure is generated.

    Additionally, their implementation is likely tailored to RNAalifold params, may want different constraints for
    KnotAli.

    Update 04/18: After trying to port the ViennaRNA codebase, it appears that most of the time was taken up with
    attempting to determine what needed to be ported and trying to adjust for a smaller scope of design. Path moving
    forward will be to work on independent methods of implementation according to functionality.

    Check the consensus method for creating a structure. May want to draw from class lecture for implementation ideas
    instead. Test with dataset Hosna provided.

    TODO:       03/06/2019 Design consensus sequence functionality.

    TODO:       04/01/2019 Design restriction structure functionality, use covariation, mutual information tests.

    TODO:       04/06/2019 Email Hosna about David Matthews for psuedoknot sequence family datasets
    COMPLETED:  04/08/2019
    TODO:       04/06/2019 Compare to ViennaRNA generated consensus sequences.
    TEST:       04/08/2019 Compare the .ct files (need converting to dot bracket) with output from RNAalifold to note
                           differences in structures.
    ADJUSTMENT: 04/18/2019 If the current decision is to implement functionality by self-design, above no longer needed.

[FILE READING]
    TODO:       04/18/2019 Implement FASTA file read for MSA.
    COMPLETED:  04/18/2019 Implemented and tested FASTA MSA file read into string vector.
    TODO:       04/18/2019 Implement CLUSTAL file read for MSA.

[CONSENSUS SEQUENCE]
    TODO:       04/10/2019 Work on porting over the consensus sequence methods, trim and modify.

    likely needed for consensus sequencing

    char *
    vrna_aln_consensus_sequence(const char      **alignment,
                                const vrna_md_t *md_p);
        Requires or needs modifying:
            vrna_md_t
            vrna_message_warning
            vrna_md_copy
            vrna_md_set_default
            vrna_alloc
            vrna_nucleotide_encode
            vrna_nucleotide_decode

[CONSENSUS STRUCTURE]
    Will likely want a more lightweight computation for entropy associations between sequences to compute a consensus
    sequence. The vrna_mfe method seems to take into account the full MFE calculation and folding, whereas we'd just
    like to have the computation of an appropriate restriction structure.

    TODO:       04/10/2019 Work on porting over the consensus sequence and structure methods, trim and modify.

    Likely needed for restriction structure USE IF POSSIBLE.
